        name: 'Diversify your choice'
        icon: cutlery
        text: We're too reliant on the "Big Five": cod, haddock, tuna, salmon and prawns. Choose species such as coley or pouting instead of cod. Herring or sardines instead of tuna.
    -
        name: 'Shop at the most responsible supermarkets'
        icon: shopping-cart
        text: Buy your seafood from supermarkets awarded through our supermarket seafood survey; Sainsbury's and M&S (gold), The Co-operative (silver) and Waitrose (bronze).
    -
        name: 'Look at labels'
        icon: tag
        text: "The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) seafood ecolabel recognises and rewards sustainable fishing and the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) certifies responsibly farmed seafood. \r\nThe Marine Conservation Society recognises MSC and ASC certified as a better environmental choice for many seafood products."
    -
        name: 'Go green'
        icon: recycle
        text: 'Choose fish caught using methods with lower environmental impact, such as hand lined or pot caught.'
    -
        name: 'Choose organic farmed seafood'
        icon: leaf
        text: 'Organic farms tend to have lower stocking densities, higher environmental standards and use feed sourced sustainably, so look for the organic label.'
    -
        name: 'Avoid eating sharks and deepwater fish'
        icon: exclamation-triangle
        text: 'Slow growing, long-lived species such as redfish and orange roughy, breed slowly and are therefore vulnerable to over-exploitation. Fishing for deep sea fish can harm other sensitive species like coldwater coral that may never recover.'
