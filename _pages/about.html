<p>Fishlove was set up in 2009 by <strong>Nicholas R&ouml;hl</strong>, co-owner of <strong>MOSHIMO</strong>, and actress <strong>Greta Scacchi</strong> to raise awareness of the unsustainable fishing practices that are destroying the the earth's marine ecosystem. Since then, the Fishlove images have succeeded in bringing the subject of over-fishing to the front covers and pages of the world's media many times over..</p>
<p>Fishlove is produced by <strong>MOSHIMO</strong>, the Brighton based Japanese restaurant and is a not-for-profit Community Interest Company, which relies on the tremendous generosity of the photographers who have taken these images and of all the charismatic people who have had their Fishlove portrait taken.</p>
