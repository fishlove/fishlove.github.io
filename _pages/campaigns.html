testimonial_text: 'If we are now changing the face of European fisheries, it is also thanks to those who gave fish a voice. Fishlove goes even further and gives fish a face - a famous one. This brilliant idea is what civic participation is about, and is perfectly in unison with my own goal: for Europeans to buy, cook and eat sustainable fish only. I can only support it and wish Fishlove success and resonance.'
testimonial_person: 'Ms Maria Damanaki'
testimonial_role: 'European Commissioner in charge of Fisheries and Maritime Affairs'
future_header: 'The Future'
future_text: "Fishlove wants to continue its work by creating more Fishlove images, by exhibiting these images around the world, and by showing them on billboards in major cities. \r\n\r\nWe are confident that the latest collection of photographs by John Swannell will be our most high-profile campaign yet, and we are presently looking for funders or sponsors to help us in our work to release these. We look forward to hearing from you."
