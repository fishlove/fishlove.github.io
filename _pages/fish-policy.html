<p>Fishlove is a campaign that supports and promotes sustainable fishing. We believe that fish stocks should be conserved so that people will be able to eat fish for generations to come, and that people who depend on fishing for their livelihoods can continue to do this into the future.</p>
<p>All of the fish shown in these photographs are commercially fished, although some species shown are regarded by scientists as being over-fished and threatened. We believe that the use of these fish in these photographs is justified so that we can highlight what species could be lost if over-fishing continues.</p>
<p>None of the fish depicted in the photographs have been specifically caught for the purposes of making these photographs, and would have been landed irrespective of whether these photographs were taken or not. Other than in very unusual circumstances, the fish we photograph are eaten afterwards.</p>
<p>Fishlove has supported a number of campaigns to promote a sustainable future for our oceans, including "The End of the Line", OCEAN2012, BLOOM, and the Deep Sea Coalition.</p>
<p>We have received support for our work from a large number of NGOs, including Greenpeace, the Marine Conservation Society, and the Environmental Justice Foundation. Maria Damanaki, the european commissioner in charge of fisheries has used our images to further her efforts to reform Europe's fisheries.</p>
<p>As we do not as yet have a source of income to support our work, we fund the project from MOSHIMO, our little Japanese restaurant in Brighton. We do not earn any money from the project, and any money we do receive goes to producing more photographs.</p>
<p>Any donations and financial assistance will be gratefully received. Please contact us at info@fishlove.co.uk or donate here.</p>
