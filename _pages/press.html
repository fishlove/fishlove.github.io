testimonial_text: 'I wanted to congratulate you on the massive amount of coverage you are getting for the latest round of images – amazing!  As I said to you on the phone when we spoke in the summer I think it is a tremendous way to get members of the public to think about the issues, and start connecting with the issue of destructive fishing practices!  Now on to Russia and China where some of the major sources of destructive fishing lie – particularly the latter.'
