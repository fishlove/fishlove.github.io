<p>We feel that the public [FISHLOVE] campaign made a massive difference, as the meeting was on track to being an unmitigated disaster. We could have had an agreement that would have watered everything down to be completely meaningless. Now we have some pretty public commitments and a basis to improve on - working with the Parliament particularly, but also in Council and with Commission.</p>
