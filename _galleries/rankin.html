<p>The problem: how could we get the media to talk about how the fishing industry was destroying our marine environment to the extent that the ocean ecosystem would collapse within a generation?</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was the problem that was presented to me one day in 2009 by Charles Clover, sitting in MOSHIMO, the Japanese restaurant in Brighton I co-own with Karl Jones,&rdquo; says Fishlove producer Nicholas R&ouml;hl. &ldquo;He had come to us because of our work on fish sustainability, and wanted our help in launching his seminal film on the crisis, The End of the Line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The solution: to create a series of striking images of celebrated personalities communing fish that would provoke people into reassessing our relationship to fish &ndash;&nbsp;and provoke the media out of their silence on the issue.</p>
<p>The iconic image taken by Rankin of actress Greta Scacchi became an overnight sensation, helping to change the face of the campaign to save our oceans.</p>
