<p>&ldquo;Deep-sea ecosystems are the greatest unexplored habitat in the world. An overwhelming body of scientific opinion suggests that we should be doing everything to protect them. Why, then, do we allow economically unprofitable practices that cause them significant long-term damage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fishlove asked the French portrait photographer Denis Rouvre to do our third series to help with the BLOOM campaign to end destructive deep sea fishing in Europe. The portraits of Gillian Anderson, Goldie and a many French celebrities became a global media sensation which helped raise awareness of this little known issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The vote to end deep sea fishing at the European Parliament failed on a technicality, and so the fight continues to save the deep sea from pointless destruction.</strong></p>
