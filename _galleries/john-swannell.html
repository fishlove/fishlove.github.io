<p><strong>"Five Celebrities. Five Oceans. Five things we need to do to save them".</strong> Fishlove's John Swannell series was released to the Sunday Times and the Evening Standard to mark World Oceans Day. To read the press release, click <a href="https://fishlove.co.uk/campaigns.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>In February 2015, Helena Bonham-Carter&rsquo;s portrait from the same series was released early as part of the Blue Marine Foundation and Oceans 5 campaign to protect 20% of the world's oceans by 2020 - and was&nbsp;credited as being instrumental in persuading the UK Government to commit to creating the largest marine protected area in the world.</p>
<p>John Swannell's series has&nbsp;resulted in one of our biggest media successes to date.</p>
